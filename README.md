# LiveKit HTTPS experiment

## The needs
folder 0: prerequisites

folder 1: Basic Functionality

folder 2: Extra functionality

folder 3: Clubhouse like clone

------

```
Folder 0 will contain:

Step by step documentation of commands and comments regarding the installation of LiveKit on the backend server and the steps for setting up the flutter project with LiveKit configuration



Folder 1 will contain:

Basic audio and video calls and group calls between users. I think this is the most basic thing every social app has



Folder 2 will contain:

Extra features like the app that you already made where where users can join other rooms etc



Folder 3 will contain:

Basically a more complete solution using all of the above.

I don't care much of UI and ofcourse I am willing to pay any code part that you think it will take you time. Either by purchasing codecanyon scripts or finding someone to help us at any stage or issue we might have.
